# Collects memory metrics such as total, free, buffer, cached and swap space
# This can be sent to logstash for some little mangling so that it
# can be stored in a datastore like Elasticsearch. See
# github.com/CumulusNetworks/logstash-conf for more details on the logstash config.
# CPU metrics are collected every 10 seconds.
