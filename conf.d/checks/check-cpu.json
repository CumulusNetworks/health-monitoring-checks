# This is an example standard check that executes the plugin
# check-cpu.rb. it sets the default critical threshold at 99%
# with a warning alert issued at 95%
# the check is triggered only if 3 occurrences happen within 10 minutes
# Then every 10 minutes, if 3 occurrences happen again, another alert is triggered
# The default handler is to send the event to logstash.
