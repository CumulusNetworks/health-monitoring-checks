There are a couple of dependencies to be aware of:

* Ensure you've either installed httplib2 or are using Ansible 2.x
* Ensure that you don't have InfluxDB running locally or you'll have port forwarding conflicts with Vagrant. This same goes for other open ports that may be in conflict.
 

To Access the Monitoring demo:
* http://localhost:3000 - grafana dashboard. admin/admin to login
